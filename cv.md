#### Summary:
I work as a graphic designer with a focus on a webdesign for about 8 years. Unfortunately in some cases when I open websites made by my layouts..they are not what I meant at all. So I'm interested in what's going on under the hood of all that things and want to make websites looking and acting as I want them to do.

#### Skills:
- HTML / CSS (SaSS) (4/5)
- Javascript (4/5)
- Typescript (2/5)
- React + Redux (1/5)
- Git, Webpack, ESLint and graphic apps (Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator)

#### English
My English level is about B1 (Listening and Reading much better than Speaking and Writing)
