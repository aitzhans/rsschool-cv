#### Summary:
I work as a graphic designer with a focus on a webdesign for quite some time. Unfortunately in some cases when I open websites made by my layouts.. They are not what I meant at all. So I'm interested in what's going on under the hood of all that things and want to make websites looking and acting as I want them to do. 

#### Skills:
- HTML (4/5)
- CSS (3/5)
- javascript (1/5)

#### Code examples
Don't have too much to show, so I'll publish one of my codewars solutions:
```javascript
function positiveSum(arr) {
  let result = arr.reduce( (sum, current) => (current > 0) ? sum + current : sum, 0);
  return result;
}
```

#### Experience
I don't have a serious work experience in frontend development. 

#### Education
I'm self-taught person with no special education. And well.. I'm a student in RS School:))

#### English
My English level is about B1 (Listening and Reading much better than Speaking and Writing)
